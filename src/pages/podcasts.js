        <p className="podcasts__paragraph">
          In spring of 2019 I co-founded the Ladybug Podcast with a few of my
          lady-friends where we discuss all things code and career! We publish
          weekly on Mondays! We also have a book club were we discuss popular
          career-based books.
        </p>
        <p className="podcasts__paragraph">
          Additionally I am a regular panelist on the popular podcast JSParty!
